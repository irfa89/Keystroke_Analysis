Step 1 :

The code is written in PyCharm Professional 2018.1 and requires
Anaconda distribution for convenience or the below versions or higher are
required to run the program.
1.1 scipy 1.0.1
1.2 pandas 0.22.0
1.3 numpy 1.14.0
1.4 Python 3.6.4

Step 2:

Import the source files to IDE or run in command line.
The below files has to be in same directory path.
1. keystroke_analysis.py
2. keystroke_verifier.py

The above two python scripts is in folder Keystroke_Analysis.

Step 3:

In order to load the data correct path has to 
be directed.

path and file needs to be mentioned in program
keystroke_analysis.

Step 4:

Run the "__main__" program and thresholds, training smaple size
and testing sample size has to be provided by the user.

Step 5:

Once thresholds,training size and testing sample is provided
output of False Accept Rate and False Reject Rate will be
calculated and displayed at console.

Note : 
1.The program may take approx 30 seconds to 1 minute
depending on the training and testing size. 
2. The user can provide one or many thresholds and false accept rate
and false reject rate will be calculated in corresponding index.
